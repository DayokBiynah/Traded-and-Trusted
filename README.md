# 🏀 Team-18: Trade Impact Of NBA Players on Rookies

This project analyzes first-round NBA draft picks from 2017 to 2024, focusing on how trades affect player performance using **Box Plus-Minus (BPM)**—a stat that encapsulates assists, steals, blocks, rebounds, points, turnovers, and personal fouls.

We compared traded vs. non-traded players and examined how trade history influences BPM. Using historical data, we trained a regression model to **predict a player’s Custom BPM** based on:

- Season stats
- Trade frequency
- Career progression
