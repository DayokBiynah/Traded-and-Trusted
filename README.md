# Team-18

Conducted an analysis focused on first-round NBA draft picks over the past seven seasons (2017–2024). Explored the effect of trades on a player's performance by using BPM (Box Plus-Minus) to represent general statistics such as assists, steals, blocks, rebounds, points, turnovers, and personal fouls. We made comparisons between players who were traded and those who were not, and examined the effect on their BPM.

We trained this tool uses a trained regression model to predict an NBA player's Custom BPM (Box Plus/Minus) based on key season stats, trade history, and career progress. It’s designed to simulate how trade frequency affects performance, backed by historical data.
